# **The First AI-Driven Idol Singer**

LINA AI is an innovative project that combines music generation and blockchain technology to create the first AI-driven idol singer. Using ChatGPT for lyric generation and SUNO for music composition, LINA AI represents a groundbreaking shift in the music industry by merging Web2 and Web3 technology to bring AI-generated music to the masses.

## **Project Vision**

LINA AI is designed to revolutionize the way we experience music. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence for both lyric creation and music composition, LINA serves as a virtual idol, transcending traditional music production methods. The project integrates blockchain technology to ensure that the AI-generated content can be distributed and owned within both Web2 and Web3 platforms.

## **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Lyrics**: Lyrics generated by ChatGPT based on given themes or prompts.
- **AI-Powered Music**: Music composed by SUNO, an AI music generation model capable of creating unique melodies and instrumentals.
- **Web2 and Web3 Integration**: LINA AI connects traditional music platforms (Web2) and decentralized platforms (Web3).
- **Blockchain-Powered Ownership**: AI-generated content tracked and distributed using blockchain for transparency and ownership.

## **How It Works**

LINA AI’s system is powered by two core AI technologies:
- **ChatGPT**: Generates lyrics based on user prompts or themes, providing unique and creative song lyrics.
- **SUNO**: Composes music, producing melodies and harmonies to match the generated lyrics.

Once the music and lyrics are generated, they are uploaded to major music platforms through blockchain integration, making the content accessible to a global audience.

## **Future Goals**
- **Interactive Experiences**: Develop interactive AI idol features to engage with fans via social media and digital platforms.
- **Live Performances**: Explore virtual performances using AI-generated music and visuals.
- **Decentralized Music Economy**: Enable fans to participate in the project by owning and sharing content.

## **Getting Involved**

  ## **Hardware Requirements**
- **Processor (CPU)**:
  - Minimum: Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5
  - Recommended: Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 for better performance when processing large datasets.
- **Memory (RAM)**:
  - Minimum: 8 GB
  - Recommended: 16 GB (especially if processing many lyrics at once).
- **Storage**:
  - Minimum: 500 MB free disk space for Python libraries and project files.
  - Recommended: 1 GB or more for handling large datasets or additional resources like logs and cached data.
- **Internet Connection**:
  - Required for fetching lyrics from Google and interacting with the OpenAI API.

## **Software Requirements**
- **Operating System**:
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later
  - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later recommended)
- **Python Version**:
  - 3.7 or higher (Recommended: Python 3.9 or 3.10 for better compatibility with libraries).
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `requests`: For fetching web data (lyrics).
  - `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.
  - `openai`: For interacting with OpenAI's GPT models.
  - `pandas`: For data analysis (if needed).
  - `nltk` or `spaCy` (optional for advanced text processing).

## **Python System Requirements**
Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed. You can check your Python version using the command:
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
