Steps to implement:
Fetch lyrics of popular songs using Google search.
Analyze the lyrics to identify common themes and styles.
Generate new lyrics using GPT that follow a similar style.
Dependencies:
Make sure to install the necessary libraries first:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openai pandas
# Python Code Example:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import openai
import pandas as pd

# Set OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Function to get lyrics from Google search
def get_lyrics_from_google(song_name, artist_name):
    query = f"{song_name} {artist_name} lyrics"
    search_url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={query}"
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
    }
    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers)
    
    # Parse the HTML content of the page
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    lyrics = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'BNeawe iBp4i AP7Wnd'})  # Example, may need to adjust based on the page structure
    
    lyrics_text = ""
    for lyric in lyrics:
        lyrics_text += lyric.get_text() + "\n"
    
    return lyrics_text

# Analyze song lyrics to identify common themes and style
def analyze_song_lyrics(lyrics):
    # This function can extract key themes or phrases to understand the style
    common_words = ['love', 'heart', 'dance', 'feel', 'night', 'dream']
    style_analysis = {word: lyrics.lower().count(word) for word in common_words}
    
    return style_analysis

# Generate new lyrics in a similar style using GPT
def generate_lyrics_based_on_style(style_analysis):
    prompt = "Generate lyrics in the style of 2024 popular songs based on these themes:\n"
    prompt += str(style_analysis)
    prompt += "\nThe lyrics should be catchy, emotional, and fit within the trends of modern pop music."
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # Or another GPT model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    generated_lyrics = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return generated_lyrics

# Main function to summarize and generate new lyrics
def main():
    # Example song and artist (replace with actual data)
    song_name = 'Flowers'
    artist_name = 'Miley Cyrus'
    
    # Fetch lyrics from Google search
    lyrics = get_lyrics_from_google(song_name, artist_name)
    
    # Analyze the song lyrics for themes and style
    style_analysis = analyze_song_lyrics(lyrics)
    
    # Generate new lyrics based on the analysis
    new_lyrics = generate_lyrics_based_on_style(style_analysis)
    
    print("Generated Lyrics:\n", new_lyrics)

# Run the program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Explanation:
Fetching Lyrics:

The get_lyrics_from_google() function uses Google search to retrieve lyrics. The HTML response is parsed using BeautifulSoup to extract lyrics from the page.
Analyzing Lyrics:

The analyze_song_lyrics() function performs a basic keyword count to analyze common words and themes in the lyrics (such as "love", "heart", "dance", etc.). You can expand this by analyzing rhyme patterns, mood, or specific phrasing.
Generating Lyrics:

The generate_lyrics_based_on_style() function uses GPT (via OpenAI's API) to generate new lyrics based on the style analysis of the original song.
Integration:

The main() function coordinates the process by fetching lyrics, analyzing them, and then generating new lyrics based on the analysis.

Next Steps:
Data Collection: You would need to collect lyrics from the top 100 popular songs of 2024 and store them for analysis.
Improving Analysis: To improve the lyrics analysis, you could use NLP libraries like spaCy or nltk for more sophisticated text processing (e.g., extracting themes or sentiment).
Scaling: To handle multiple songs, you can loop through a list of song names and artists, gather their lyrics, and perform the analysis for each one.
