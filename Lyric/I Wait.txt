Title: I Wait
Style of Music:
Slow, atmospheric ballad, orchestral elements, haunting piano, female vocals, emotional crescendo
[Intro, Echoing pads, soft piano]  
[Verse 1, Light piano]  
I hear your name whispered in the breeze  
A fleeting sound that I can’t seize  
Calling to the emptiness, no reply  
The cold wind carries your goodbye  

[Pre-Chorus 1, Strings rise]  
Even in this bitter night, I feel the strain  
But I won't let go of this silent pain  
The moments slip like shadows in the dark  
But I’ll hold on to what’s left of your spark  

[Chorus, Soaring vocals]  
Through the endless night, thick and cold  
I know your dreams have turned to stone  
I’ll wait here, even when hope feels thin  
I’ll find you, though you’re lost within  
Let’s go, to the edge where the morning begins  

[Verse 2, Soft piano, light strings]  
A figure stands, a child so still  
Eyes lowered, with a heart to fill  
I reach for you, but you slip away  
And I’m left with nothing but the fray  

[Pre-Chorus 2, Strings swelling]  
Though the ache cuts deep, I’ll hold the flame  
This time, I won’t forget your name  
The silence echoes louder than before  
But I’ll remember what we were waiting for  

[Chorus, Powerful vocals]  
Through the endless night, thick and cold  
I know your dreams have turned to stone  
I’ll wait here, even when hope feels thin  
I’ll find you, though you’re lost within  
Let’s go, to the edge where the morning begins  

[Bridge, Orchestral build, echoing vocals]  
Though the world is cold, I will remain  
Through the tears, through the endless rain  
I’ll chase the light, where shadows fall  
And find you, wherever you call  

[Outro, Soft piano, ambient fade]  
I call your name, but there’s no sound  
Only the silence spinning round  
In the cold, I wait, I won’t be gone  
I’ll find you, when the new day dawns
