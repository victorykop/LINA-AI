[Verse 1]  
Do you ever feel like you're stuck in a haze,  
Wishing for a way out, trying to escape?  
Do you ever feel like you're losing your spark,  
Like the world’s too heavy, it’s been tearing you apart?  
But deep inside, there’s a fire you can't ignore,  
A light so bright, you’re destined to soar.  
You just need to let it break through,  
And show the world the real you.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Just light it up, let it burn,  
It’s your time, take your turn,  
Own the night, feel alive,  
Like fireworks in the sky.

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, you're a summer light,  
Glow so fierce, you burn so bright,  
Watch them go, "Wow, wow, wow,"  
As you shine, you're taking flight  
Baby, you're a summer light,  
Let your colors fill the sky,  
Watch them go, "Wow, wow, wow,"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe.

[Verse 2]  
You don't need to play it safe,  
You're a diamond in the rough, let 'em see your grace,  
If you only knew what’s coming next,  
After the storm, you’ll find your best.  
Maybe every setback makes you rise,  
So you can show the world what’s inside your eyes.  
Like a spark lighting up the dark,  
When you move, they’ll know you’re on fire.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Just light it up, let it burn,  
It’s your time, take your turn,  
Own the night, feel alive,  
Like fireworks in the sky.

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, you're a summer light,  
Glow so fierce, you burn so bright,  
Watch them go, "Wow, wow, wow,"  
As you shine, you're taking flight  
Baby, you're a summer light,  
Let your colors fill the sky,  
Watch them go, "Wow, wow, wow,"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe.

[Bridge]  
Like a wave crashing through,  
You’ve got the power, it’s true,  
Nothing’s gonna stop you now,  
You’ll rise above, and show them how.

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, you're a summer light,  
Glow so fierce, you burn so bright,  
Watch them go, "Wow, wow, wow,"  
As you shine, you're taking flight  
Baby, you're a summer light,  
Let your colors fill the sky,  
Watch them go, "Wow, wow, wow,"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe.

[Outro]  
You’re a summer light,  
Keep shining bright,  
And leave 'em in awe...  
Awe, awe, awe...
