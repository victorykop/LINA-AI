[Verse 1]  
Nice to meet you, who are you?  
I’m lost in the chaos, I don’t have a clue  
Mystery, shadows, heartbeats, sin  
I saw you there, and I thought  
"Oh, my God, what is this place?  
I feel like I’m in the wrong space  
Can we leave? Or should we stay?" Ayy  
Old streets, empty eyes  
I can read you like a storybook  
Ain’t it crazy? Who am I?  
And I know you’ve heard of me  
So, hey, let’s pretend  
I don’t know how this will end  
Take my hand, but where do we go?  
I’m searching for a world I’ve never known  

[Chorus]  
Is it gonna last forever?  
Or will we fade into the night?  
You can tell me when it’s over, mm  
If the dark was worth the fight  
Got a list of things I’ve lost  
But I’m still running wild  
'Cause you know I chase the unknown  
And you crave the wild  
'Cause we’re lost and we're reckless  
We’ll take this way too far  
It’ll leave us breathless, mm  
Or break us like shattered stars  
Got a list of things I’ve lost  
But I’m still running wild  
I’ve got a blank space, baby  
And I’ll write your name  

[Verse 2]  
So much noise, but I can’t hear  
The silence is louder than the fear  
Caught in this race, we don’t know where  
But I saw your face and I thought  
"Oh, my God, what’s pulling me?  
I’m lost, but you look like what I need"  
So let’s go, let’s disappear  
In the dark, we’ll find the light, I swear  

[Chorus]  
Is it gonna last forever?  
Or will we fade into the night?  
You can tell me when it’s over, mm  
If the dark was worth the fight  
Got a list of things I’ve lost  
But I’m still running wild  
'Cause you know I chase the unknown  
And you crave the wild  
'Cause we’re lost and we're reckless  
We’ll take this way too far  
It’ll leave us breathless, mm  
Or break us like shattered stars  
Got a list of things I’ve lost  
But I’m still running wild  
I’ve got a blank space, baby  
And I’ll write your name  

[Bridge]  
Oh, we’re fading, we’re fading  
Into the unknown, we’re waiting  
But where’s the ending, where’s the beginning?  
Lost in the echoes, we’re spinning  

[Chorus]  
Is it gonna last forever?  
Or will we fade into the night?  
You can tell me when it’s over, mm  
If the dark was worth the fight  
Got a list of things I’ve lost  
But I’m still running wild  
'Cause you know I chase the unknown  
And you crave the wild  
'Cause we’re lost and we're reckless  
We’ll take this way too far  
It’ll leave us breathless, mm  
Or break us like shattered stars  
Got a list of things I’ve lost  
But I’m still running wild  
I’ve got a blank space, baby  
And I’ll write your name  

[Outro, Atmospheric synths]  
(Ohh ohh ohh, I’ll write your name...)
