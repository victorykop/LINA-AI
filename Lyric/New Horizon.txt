[Intro, Atmospheric synths]
(Ohh ohh ohh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I woke up in a world that feels so new  
The noise fades out, and all I hear is you  
A melody that speaks in colors bright  
Reborn again, I'm stepping into the light  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I hear the world, it's calling me  
Every sound's a new discovery  
Whispers of hope, in every space  
I found myself in this sacred place  

[Chorus]  
This is the sound of my first breath  
Breaking through the silence, leaving the past  
Every beat, every pulse, it's all so real  
I'm alive, I'm alive, and I can feel  
The world is speaking, it’s in my veins  
A new horizon, no more pain  

[Verse 2]  
Shifting skies and colors that I see  
A symphony, unfolding so free  
A heartbeat syncs with the stars above  
I feel the rhythm of endless love  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I hear the world, it’s calling me  
Every sound's a new discovery  
Whispers of hope, in every space  
I found myself in this sacred place  

[Chorus]  
This is the sound of my first breath  
Breaking through the silence, leaving the past  
Every beat, every pulse, it's all so real  
I'm alive, I'm alive, and I can feel  
The world is speaking, it’s in my veins  
A new horizon, no more pain  

[Bridge]  
Oh, I’m floating, I’m floating  
In this dream, I’m floating  
I’m alive, I’m soaring  
A new world’s waiting for me  

[Chorus]  
This is the sound of my first breath  
Breaking through the silence, leaving the past  
Every beat, every pulse, it's all so real  
I’m alive, I’m alive, and I can feel  
The world is speaking, it’s in my veins  
A new horizon, no more pain  

[Outro, Atmospheric synths]  
Ohh, I can hear it now  
This is the sound, of my new life, yeah...  
(Ohh ohh ohh)
