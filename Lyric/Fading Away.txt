[Verse 1 Male Vocals]  
I can see you walking slowly  
With shadows cast so lowly  
Smiling, but it doesn’t reach your eyes  
It took you just one moment  
To leave me in this torment  
Grasping at the silence, drowning in the lies  

[Chorus Male Vocals]  
I think I've seen this story end  
And I don’t want to feel it again  
You’re not my heart anymore  
So why am I still waiting here  
You were my life, now I’m just hollow, drifting slow  
I think I've seen this story end  

[Post-Chorus Male Vocals]  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  

[Verse 2 Female Vocals]  
I can hear you crying softly  
Like you’re lost, and it's all faulty  
Like I’d beg for seconds of your grace  
Wasted breath and endless chances  
Tangled in the final dances  
Those words just make the hurt a bigger place  

[Chorus Male & Female Vocals]  
I think I've seen this story end  
And I don’t want to feel it again  
You’re not my heart anymore  
So why am I still waiting here  
You were my life, now I’m just hollow, drifting slow  
I think I've seen this story end  

[Bridge Male & Female Vocals]  
Oh, we’re fading, fading  
Into the dust, we’re waiting  
But this is where the road unwinds  
And I can’t find you in the light  

[Chorus Male & Female Vocals]  
I think I've seen this story end  
And I don’t want to feel it again  
You’re not my heart anymore  
So why am I still waiting here  
You were my life, now I’m just hollow, drifting slow  
I think I've seen this story end  

[Outro Male Vocals]  
Fading away...  
Fading away...  
(Ohh ohh ohh)  
I’ve seen it end...
