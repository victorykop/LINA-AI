[Verse 1]  
We stand here now, so broken, tears falling like the rain  
And if I'm a shadow, you'll fade with me just the same  
Even in my darkest hour, did I deserve, love?  
All the pain you gave me  
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you  
'Til the very end  

[Chorus]  
I didn’t have the strength to let you go with grace  
And you're the one who hides behind a smile, saving face  
And if I’m gone to you, why are you still near?  
Whispering my name, wishing I’d stayed here  
Look at how my heart won’t fade away  

[Verse 2]  
We collect memories, not knowing what they'll bring  
Some to treasure, some to bury, lost in everything  
I didn’t want to be a ghost in your life  
But here I am, unseen  
You wear the love that I gave you  
As you leave me to dream  

[Chorus]  
I didn’t have the strength to let you go with grace  
When I would fight, you’d say I was brave  
And if I’m gone to you, why are you still near?  
Whispering my name, wishing I’d stayed here  
Look at how my heart won’t fade away  

[Bridge]  
Oh, you’ll remember me  
I know you'll remember me  
Even when I’m far away  
I’ll haunt you in every way  
You’ll remember me  

[Chorus]  
I didn’t have the strength to let you go with grace  
And you're the one who hides behind a smile, saving face  
And if I’m gone to you, why are you still near?  
Whispering my name, wishing I’d stayed here  
Look at how my heart won’t fade away  

[Outro, Soft piano]  
I’ll be here, always, in your memory  
(Ohh ohh ohh)  
Remember me...
